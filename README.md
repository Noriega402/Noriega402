- 1. Hi, I’m @Noriega402
- 2. I’m interested in learning more about 
      web development and desktop applications.
  
- 3. I’m currently learning the CodeIgniter and Laravel framework,
      very soon I hope to use Angular, React and NodeJS.
- 4. I’m looking to collaborate with small projects, while I can improve my skills.

Noriega402/Noriega402 It is a special repository because it is my progress with programming and
I feel that I have improved in these last 2 years. I do not consider myself an expert,
my projects are simple but honest.
