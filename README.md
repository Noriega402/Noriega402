 # Hi, I’m @Noriega402
 - I’m interested in learning more about web development and desktop applications.
 - I’m currently learning the CodeIgniter and Laravel framework very soon I hope to use Angular, React and NodeJS.
 - I’m looking to collaborate with small projects, while I can improve my skills.
